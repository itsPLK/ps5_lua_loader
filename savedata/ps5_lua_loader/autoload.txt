# ps5_lua_loader
# autoload config file
# -------------------------
# Loader looks for this config file (ps5_lua_loader/autoload.txt) in the following directories (highest priority first):
# - USB drives,
# - /data directory,
# - Lua game savedata directory.
# Only the first autoload.txt found will be used; subsequent files will be ignored.
#
# This file should contain the names of ELF payloads (.elf or .bin) and Lua scripts (.lua) to be loaded.
# (one file name per line)
# ELF files will be sent to elf_loader. Lua scripts will be executed synchronously.
# Lines starting with ! will be treated as sleep commands (e.g., !1000 will sleep for 1000ms).
#
# umtx.lua and elf_loader will be started automatically and shouldn't be included here.
