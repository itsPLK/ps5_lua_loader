## PS5 Lua Loader

Fork of [remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader)

Automatically loads umtx kernel exploit, elfloader, your elf payloads, and Lua scripts.
Supports PS5 firmwares up to 10.01 (above 7.61 uses [lapse exploit](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader/blob/main/payloads/lapse.lua), which is currently unstable).

## How to use
* Create a directory named `ps5_lua_loader`.
* Inside this directory, place your .elf/.bin/.lua files, and an `autoload.txt` file.
    * In autoload.txt, list the files you want to load (one per line).
    * Filenames are case-sensitive - make sure the names exactly match your files.
    * You can add lines like `!1000` to make the loader wait 1000ms before sending the next payload.
    * Note: Do not put kernel exploit (e.g. `umtx.lua`) or elfloader in `autoload.txt`, as they are loaded automatically.
* Put the `ps5_lua_loader` directory in one of these locations:
    * In the root of a USB drive
    * In the internal drive at `/data/ps5_lua_loader`
    * In the game’s savedata folder
* Import savedata to your game:  
  Follow the steps in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to prepare and import the savedata for your Lua-compatible game.
